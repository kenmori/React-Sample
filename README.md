# React ES6 Flux PlayGround

## To use

### Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Start server

```sh
gulp
```

####
I think that it is unnecessary, there is a file of around Flux as an example,
```playground/src/component/ParentComponent.js``` is ParentComponent

#### local server start
```Server started: http://localhost:3000/```
